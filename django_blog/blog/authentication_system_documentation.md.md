## System Components

### Registration
The registration system allows new users to sign up by providing a username, email, and password. It verifies user input, such as ensuring unique emails and secure passwords.

### Login
The login system authenticates users based on their provided credentials (username or email and password). It uses Django's authentication methods to verify user identity and initiate a user session.

### Password Reset
Users who forget their password can request a password reset. The system sends a password reset email, allowing the user to create a new password.

### Logout
The logout system ends the user's session, ensuring they no longer have access to restricted areas of the website after they log out.
